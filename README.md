# 🌌 Solar System Prototype with Unity

**Solar System Prototype with Unity** is a fun and educational project that simulates the movements and interactions of celestial bodies within our solar system. Developed using Unity, this prototype offers an interactive 3D representation of the Sun, planets, and moons, allowing users to explore and learn about the solar system in an engaging way.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Realistic Celestial Body Movements:** The prototype accurately simulates the orbits and rotations of the Sun, planets, and moons based on real-world data, providing an immersive experience.

- **Interactive User Controls:** Users can navigate through the solar system using intuitive controls, zoom in and out, and observe celestial bodies from different angles.

- **Educational Information:** Each celestial body is accompanied by informative pop-ups, providing essential facts and details about the planets, their moons, and other celestial phenomena.

- **Dynamic Lighting and Textures:** The prototype features dynamic lighting and high-resolution textures, enhancing the visual appeal and realism of the solar system environment.

- **Time Manipulation:** Users can control the flow of time to observe the changing positions of celestial bodies at different points in history or the future.
